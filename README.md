## Abstract
With a proliferation of custom IPs in the market, it is becoming increasingly challenging for Architects to integrate these IPs  at system-level to evaluate their performance and drive design space exploration. Architects put in considerable effort and have to focus on low-level integration details to ensure functional correctness and performance correlation with real silicon. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a framework ERAS that provides a platform for swift integration of RTL IP models (convertible to C-description) with high-level architecture simulators such as Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST). The integration workflow automatically generates the SST wrapper component based on user description and carries necessary interfaces to ’plug’ the RTL model with the SST framework.
